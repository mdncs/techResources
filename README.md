Over the years I've managed to accummulate a ridiculous amount of bookmarks on the most random topics. I've decided to comb through them and organise the ones I deemed to be most useful, mostly tech-related.

This is a repo with resources from all over the Internet on things like coding + tutorials (JS and Python, CSS, interviewing for jobs), Linux and Security, Machine Learning and AI (dev resources for beginners + insightful articles), online privacy, open-source stuff, and a miscellaneous file for bookmarks that I think are pretty cool but don't fit into one category.
